## Introduction

I executed hands-on cybersecurity forensics and threat analysis projects, leveraging industry-standard tools to investigate and mitigate complex cyber threats. These projects showcase expertise in memory, network, and disk forensics, as well as advanced threat hunting and malware analysis techniques to uncover attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
